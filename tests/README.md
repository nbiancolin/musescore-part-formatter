# Guide to writing tests

Yes you have to do it! Especially when you think  "oh I don't have to do this"

General guidelines for writing tests:
- Create a new sample score for the test you are writing
    - Can even name the sample score the name of the test. Creating sample data honestly takes like 5 mins, its not ery difficult
- Then, inspect the output mscz/mscx file
    - TODO[]: Maybe create helper fns for inspecting the outputted files?
