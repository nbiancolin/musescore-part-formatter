POC for programmatically

debating options -- whether its better to do this programmatically somehow? or just send it to an LLM? no idea yet, will experiment

Things it needs to do:
- Add the text in a consistent spot according to data in database (Number, Show Title)
- Add double bar lines at rehearsal marks
- Drum Parts should add the text for long and broken up slashes
- Add Line Breaks (LLM?)
-
